Hi there! 

This theme is inspired by DixieMech's 8008 GMK keyset!

I was sitting there one day, trying to browse the theme market place for the perfect 8008 looking theme to match my vscode to my smexy looking keyboard but alas, there were none, and so I made my own!

Hope there are others that also enjoy the theme! Perhaps it isn't perfect yet, but as I trial it I will update it to accommodate as many languages as possible!

Regards my fellow theme and keyboard enthusiasts!

Jejunum (thats me!) signing out!
